			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The main focus of my research is to explore the factors that influence toilet duration. I began collecting data on October 5th and continued until November 3rd, for a total of 18 days and 126 records. The dataset includes both <strong>objective</strong> and <strong>subjective</strong> datas.

			</p>
			<h3>Objective Data:</h3>
			<p>Date</p>
			<p>Toilet duration (minutes)</p>
			<p>Time spent on my phone during each toilet visit(minutes)</p>
			<p>Daily number of toilet visits</p>
			<p>Daily amount of water/beverage intake (ml),</p> 
			<p>Daily amount of dietary fiber intake (g)</p>
			<p>Phone distraction level(1-10 point)</p> 
			<p>Phone content category (game, news, social media)</p>
			<h3>Subjective Data</h3>
			<p>Degree of phone distraction during each toilet visit (1-10 points)</p>
			<p>motion score before each toilet visit (1-10)</p>
			<p class="fiveelementspragraph">
				After creating and analyzing multiple scatterplots during previous exercises, I decided to <strong>focus on</strong> the relationships among five key variables: </p>
			<p><strong>Toilet Duration</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Phone Content Category</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Phone Distraction Level</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Emotion score</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Phone Use Duration(time spent on the phone during each toilet visit)</strong></p></strong>
			<p>Through several rounds of hypothesis testing, I refined my research focus and selected three hypotheses to visualize and evaluate in this project:</p>
			</p>
			<p>To test and visualize these hypotheses, I developed three different types of visualizations:</p>
			<p>A <strong>Scatterplot</strong> for Hypothesis 1,</p> 
			<p>A <strong>Parallel Coordinates Plot</strong> for Hypothesis 2,</p>
			<p>A <strong>Cluster Aubble Map</strong> for Hypothesis 3.</p> 
			<p>Each visualization emphasizes a distinct relationship among my tracked variables and contributes to understanding how phone usage behavior affects toilet duration.</p>

			<h2><strong>Sketch 1 Scatterplot: Relationship Between Phone Use Time and Toilet Hour</strong></h2>
			<h4>Hypothesis: As my phone use distraction level increases, my time spent on the toilet increases. In addition, phone content category might positively affect my time spent on the toilet.</h4>
			<p>Each bubble represents one toilet event. 
				The <strong>X-axis</strong> shows time spent on my phone during each toilet visit (minutes), and the <strong>Y-axis</strong> shows total toilet duration (minutes). </p> 
			<p> The <strong>size</strong> of each bubble encodes the degree of phone distraction (1-10), and the <strong>color</strong> represents phone content type(<span style="color:#f28e2b;">Game:Oringe</span>; <span style="color:#4e79a7;">>News: Blue</span>; <span style="color:#f17fc3;">Social Media: Pink</span>; <span style="color:#bab0ab;">None((do not use the phone)): Grey</span>).</p>				
			<p>From this figure, a clear upward trend can be observed: data points cluster along a diagonal rising from the lower left to the upper right, indicating that the longer the phone is used, the longer the toilet duration tends to be.
			<p>Larger bubbles—representing higher levels of distraction—appear mainly in the upper-right area, further reinforcing this positive correlation.
			Color patterns reveal that entertainment-related content (such as games and social media) is typically associated with longer toilet durations than informational content (news) or cases without phone use.
			Together, these visual patterns confirm that both higher distraction levels and specific content types contribute to extended toilet duration.</p>
			<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
			<p>
				The visualization supports Hypothesis 1

			<h2><strong>Sketch 2 Parallel Coordinates Plot: Phone Use Time VS Emotion Score by Content Type</strong></h2>
			<h4>Hypothesis: As emotion score increases, phone use duration tends to increase. In addition, higher emotion scores are more often associated with the use of game content, which typically corresponds to longer phone use than other content types.</h4>
			<p>This sketch uses a <strong>parallel coordinates plot</strong> to explore how emotion score relates to phone use duration, and how this relationship is influenced by phone content type.</p>
			<p>Three axes are included:</p>
			<p>Phone Use Duration (minutes)</p>
			<p>Emotion Score (1-10) Points</p>
			<p>Phone Content Type (<span style="color:#f28e2b;">Game:Oringe</span>; <span style="color:#4e79a7;">>News: Blue</span>; <span style="color:#f17fc3;">Social Media: Pink</span>; <span style="color:#bab0ab;">None((do not use the phone)):Grey</span>)</p>
			<p>Each line represents a single toilet session, and its color encodes the phone content type used during that session. This allows the viewer to trace how one event moves across the three dimensions simultaneously.</p>
			<p>From this figure, a clear upward trend can be observed: many lines rise from lower emotion scores toward higher phone use durations, indicating that higher emotion levels are generally associated with longer phone use.</p>
			<p>Lines corresponding to game content tend to appear more frequently at higher emotion scores and connect to the upper range of phone use duration, reinforcing the idea that game usage is linked with longer sessions.</p>
			<p>In contrast, lines representing news or none content types show flatter or even downward patterns, suggesting shorter and more stable phone use regardless of emotion level.</p>
			<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
			<p>
				This parallel coordinates plot confirm that increased emotion scores correspond to increased phone use duration, and that game content further strengthens this relationship.

			<h2><strong>Sketch 3 Cluster Bubble Map: Toilet Duration vs Emotion Score by Content Type</strong></h2>
			<h4>Hypothesis: As phone distraction increases, toilet duration increases. In addition, entertainment content such as games or social media might reinforce this effect, especially under higher emotion scores.</h4>
			<p>This cluster bubble map organizes toilet session data across two categorical dimensions: <strong>emotion level(1-10point)</strong> (columns) and <strong>phone distraction level(1-10point)</strong> (rows). 
			Each circle represents one toilet event. 
			The <strong>size</strong> of each bubble corresponds to the <strong>toilet duration (minutes)</strong>, while the <strong>color</strong> indicates the <strong>phone content type(<span style="color:#f28e2b;">Game:Oringe</span>; <span style="color:#4e79a7;">>News: Blue</span>; <span style="color:#f17fc3;">Social Media: Pink</span>; <span style="color:#bab0ab;">None((do not use the phone)):Grey</span>)</strong> 
			</p>
			<p>By arranging data in a 3*3 grid, the map visually compares patterns across combinations of emotional and distraction states. Clusters in the lower-right region (high emotion + high distraction) tend to include larger and more numerous bubbles, 
			suggesting that both higher distraction and emotional intensity are associated with longer toilet durations. Within these clusters, entertainment-related content (such as games and social media) appears more frequently, supporting the hypothesis that content type may strengthen the relationship.</p>
			<p>In addition, positions within each cell are not numerically meaningful but rather indicate the <strong>density and relative frequency</strong> of events within that group.
			This structure emphasizes categorical comparison and pattern recognition instead of continuous correlation.</p>
			<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
			<p>
				The pattern reveals that toilet sessions become longer under conditions of high distraction and high emotional arousal, confirming the interactive effect described in the hypothesis.
				This categorical clustering visually demonstrates how psychological and behavioral variables combine to influence toilet duration.<a href="sketch3.pdf">View Sketch3 PDF </a>
