        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p><strong>As phone attractiveness level increases, toilet duration tends to increase. Pre-toilet emotion level and phone content type also have an influence on toilet duration.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Hypothesis Revision and Variable Refinement</h2>
        <p>Initially, my hypothesis <strong>was</strong>:</p>
        <p>“As my phone use during toilet time increases, my time spent on the toilet increases.”</p>
        <p>However, as I continued recording the data, I realized that my phone usage time during toilet sessions was almost identical to the total toilet duration itself.</p> 
        <p>This obvious overlap made phone usage time less meaningful as an independent variable, as it did not provide deeper insight into the underlying reasons behind toilet duration. </p>
        <p>In addition, using phone time would occupy one visual dimension of the scatterplot without contributing much explanatory value.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I revised my hypothesis to:</p>
        <p>“As phone attractiveness level increases, toilet duration tends to increase.”</p>
        <p>I also introduced phone content category as an additional variable.</p> 
        <p>Together, these changes allowed the visualization to better support the exploration of my hypothesis and provided more insight into behavioral patterns rather than simply measuring time redundancy.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Scatter Plots Were Chosen</h2>
        <p>Scatter plots can intuitively display the complex the relationships between multiple variables, including continuous variables (attractiveness level, toilet duration, and phone usage time) and a categorical variable (content type). </p>
        <p>Moreover, they present information clearly and are easy to read. Compared to other chart types, scatter plot make it very easy to identify trends.</p>
        
        <h2>Scatterplot Analysis</h2>
        <p>Based on the scatterplot, I observe a clear positive relationship between phone attractiveness level and toilet duration. As phone attractiveness increases, my toilet time generally becomes longer, suggesting that higher perceived engagement with my phone is associated with spending more time in the restroom. A similar trend can be observed with my emotion score: higher emotional states before using the toilet are more frequently associated with longer durations.</p>
        <p>Content type also appears to influence my toilet behavior. When my emotion score is high, I tend to play games or use social media. When my emotion score is lower, I am more likely to browse social media or read news, although there are a few instances where I play games even at low emotional levels. News consumption during toilet sessions is mostly concentrated in shorter durations, generally under 15 minutes, while social media usage spans a wide range of durations. In comparison, game sessions are more often associated with both higher phone attractiveness and longer toilet durations.</p>
        <p>Overall, when my perceived phone attractiveness is low, I mostly engage with news or social media and tend to spend less time in the restroom. When phone attractiveness is high, my behavior shifts toward gaming, which is usually accompanied by longer toilet duration and higher emotion scores. These patterns suggest that my emotional state and content choice both play an important role in shaping my toilet phone-use behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>Unresolved Issue</h2>
        <p>I attempted to use CSS media queries to make the scatter plot responsive across different screen sizes. However, when designing the layout for screens around 760px width, I was not able to achieve the desired result after multiple attempts.</p>
        <p>The main issues I encountered were the following:</p>
        <p><strong>The text content sometimes appeared above the scatter plot instead of below it.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Part of the left side of the scatter plot became hidden outside the screen and could not be scrolled into view, unlike the right side.</strong></p>
        <p>Due to time constraints, this issue has not been fully resolved in the final submission. In future iterations, I plan to seek help from my classmates and instructor to resolve this issue.</p>
